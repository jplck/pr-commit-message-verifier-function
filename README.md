### Setup with Azure DevOps
Follow the steps below to setup the application and infrastructure.

#### Prerequisites
1. Create a service connection named "prdemoappsc" or choose a custom name. If you have choosen a custom name, make sure to change the name of the service connection in your pipeline definition.
2. Define the name of your function app in your libary as parameter "functionAppName".
3. Define the name of your resource group in your libary as parameter "rgName". 
3. Define your subscription id in your libary as parameter "subscriptionId". 
3. Define your project prefix in your libary as parameter "projectPrefix". 
3. Define your PAT in your libary as parameter "PAT".

#### Pipeline Setup
1. Start the pipeline creation by selecting this GitHub repository.
2. You will be asked to configure your pipeline. Select "Existing Azure Pipeline YAML file" for the list of options. In the popup window, select the main branch and "pipelines/deploy_func.yml" as path. Just save (not save & run) the pipeline.
3. Create another pipeline as in step 2 but select "pipelines/deploy_infrastrucuture.yml" this time. You can save & run after you have setup the pipeline.

#### Pull Request Setup
1. Create service hook to Service Bus Queue in Azure DevOps. Take the SAS Connection String from either the Azure portal or CLI. The queue name is generated by the infrastructure pipeline and is, if not changed, "prevents".
2. Create a branch policy and add a status check "verifiers/commit-verification". Open the advanced settings and enable the "Reset status whenever there are new changes" box.
